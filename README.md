# SoulPlay

## Usage
To run our Node application, download the directory and run the command "node app.js" in a CL-interface. Then visit localhost:8080 in your browser to interact with the webpage. 

## Inspiration
We were inspired by mood playlist generators and general mental health concerns arising from the pandemic.

## What it does
Our website asks users to fill out a survey about their mental health during the pandemic and recommends them a Spotify playlist to boost their mood.

## How we built it
We created our application using Node.js and Express.js. HTML and CSS were used for design elements on the webpage.

## Challenges we ran into
Linking the user interface to the backend data retrieval was tricky since we were inexperienced with Express.js.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We were able to produce our product with good UI, and we learned new technologies during the hackathon. Although we were from different timezones, we managed to coordinate and do our work.

## What we learned
We learned about pub.js in express to do this and other Java Script methods.

## What's next for SoulPlay
We want to include more features like a powerful algorithm to detect their mode and make them engage with community. We also want to include a feature where people can meet like minded professionals who are doing various jobs to improve networking opportunity.
